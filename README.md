You are provided a CSV file from TechCrunch that contains funding data for a large number of American companies.

Your task is to populate a database with only entries of **unique**, **web** companies at their **most recent** round of funding. If there is more than one round of funding on the same date, choose the higher amount.

You must create a script for populating the database.

There are no specs; you are responsible for verifying the progress of your work.

Your final deliverable should be a DB with 754 entries.

Bonus: Which Company has the highest funding round relative to the average of its state?
